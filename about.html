            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              ConsumeWise was founded with a clear mission: to bridge the knowledge gap between Pakistani consumers and the packaged food products they purchase every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a market where food labeling can be confusing, inconsistent, or misleading, we aim to empower consumers with the information they need to make healthier choices aligned with their personal health goals and dietary requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through innovative technology and a deep understanding of the local food ecosystem, we're making nutrition science accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or education level.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
          <p>
            ConsumeWise began as a passion project in 2024 when our founder, a nutritionist and tech enthusiast, noticed how difficult it was for average Pakistani consumers to decipher food labels and understand what they were really eating.
          </p>
          <p>
            After witnessing family members struggle with diet-related health issues despite their best efforts to eat healthily, we realized the problem wasn't a lack of will but a lack of accessible information.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a simple idea to translate food labels into actionable health insights has grown into a comprehensive platform that combines cutting-edge AI technology with deep nutritional expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, ConsumeWise is on a mission to revolutionize how Pakistani consumers interact with food products, making every shopping trip an opportunity to make healthier choices.
